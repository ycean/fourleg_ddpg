# fourleg_ddpg

This simulation package is meant to train the quadruped robot to walk with the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), 
and also the modified ddpg with the physic informed neural network(PINN).

The objective of this modification is to improve the learning performance for the walking robot from the DDPG algorithm.
In which PINN has the potential in reducing the estimation error of the neural netowrk through the physical informed neural network.

Other than improvement for thelearning algorithm, the walking locomotion behavior training is take into account in this research.
